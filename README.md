# Pokedex

This app was designed with HTML, CSS, and ES6+ JavaScript for the average, working trainer who needs a simple, portable Pokédex for their quest to catch 'em all! I built it throughout the intro to JavaScript course of my CareerFoundry bootcamp. Specifically, the app covers all 150 Pokémon from the original red/blue games that took the world by storm in the late 1990s.

Features
We took a functional programming approach, and initially did as much in JavaScript over HTML as possible to practice and learn (before implementing Bootstrap).
Loaded data from the RESTful Pokémon API: PokéAPI
Polyfills:
Fetch and Promise
The trainer/user can:
View all 150 Pokémon
Click on a Pokémon for a modal pop-up to show important information needed to aid them as they battle and capture it.

Dependencies
This Pokédex app relies on Bootstrap. I created a fully functional app, then, in the final section, had to rework everything to utilize some of Bootstrap's features and components (such as their navbar and modals).

Credit and Contact
This Pokédex and its creator owe a big thanks to PokeAPI and its creators, because that API was invaluable in bringing this app to life. Another thank you goes out to Nintendo and everyone involved who provided the content for a fun web development project.

I'd also like to thank CareerFoundry, my tutor Ignatius for helping me throughout this project's creation.

If any of you trainers/users have thoughts on how I can improve the Pokédex, or even this README, don't hesitate to reach out! Here's my personal contact page.
